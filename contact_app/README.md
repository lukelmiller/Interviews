# contact_app

A mockup contact app made with flutter/dart.

PROMP:
Create a mobile application in Flutter/Dart.
The application will manipulate a contact list. Persistence to a back end is not required.

The application will be evaluated on:

  2. Routing in general
  4. Overall architecture and code quality
  5. Styling and Animations

Requirements for the application are as follows.

2. Contact information should consist of:
  a. First name
  b. Last name
  c. Phone number
  d. Email address
3. Initially the user should be viewing a screen with a list of existing contacts. In the contacts list, a contact should be shown with a card style layout. Each card should consist of:
  a. First name
  b. Last name
  c. Phone number
4. From the Contact Listing screen, the user should be able to:
  a. Edit an existing contact
    i. All fields are editable
    ii. Create a separate screen for editing
  b. View a contact
    i. Click on a contact view all their information
  c. Delete an existing user
    i. A simple delete with a confirmation popup. Are you sure you want to delete “Contact”?
  d. Create a new contact
